# movie-data
**Problem Statement:**
1. In this project I am doing the analysis of movies from IMDB.
2. The dataset has about 5000+ data points. So I am going to use python to perform my analysis.
3. The dataset has movies from 1920s to 2016, so the data gave me a very good insight into the various aspects of movie industry, right from profitable movies, range of profits earned by the movies, favourite genres, favourite actors, interest of the people for movies over the decades etc.

**Design and Analysis Approach:**
1. At first I tried to understand the data better, and then started the cleaning process using python.
2. I have used Jupyther Notebook to perform the analysis.
3. I have dropped the missing values and duplicate values since they are small in number. Also I have dropped unwanted columns and replaced ‘None’ values with most common values.
4. I have then analysed the data using statistical analysis and prepared charts where-ever required.
