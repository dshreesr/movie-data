**Problem Statement:**
1. To perform exploratory data analysis on the IMDB movie data-set.

**Analysis Approach:**
1. At first I tried to understand the data better, and then started the cleaning process using python.
2. I have used Jupyther Notebook to perform the analysis.
3. I have dropped the missing values and duplicate values since they are small in number. Also I have dropped unwanted columns and replaced ‘None’ values with most common values.
4. I have then analysed the data using statistical analysis and prepared charts where-ever required.
